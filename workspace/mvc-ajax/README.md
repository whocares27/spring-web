# mvc-ajax

Many web applications use forms to process user input of some kind. In a prior lab you performed a typical
'edit' scenario where a form was used to capture changes and then POSTed back to the server. You also have
implemented the search scenario by also submitting a request to the server using a GET type
invocation and then displayed the search results. In this lab, you will put into practice
some of the AJAX principles in order to build a more rich style of interaction for performing the search.

What you will have a chance to practice:

1. How to use the [jQuery](http://jquery.com) library to decorate and modify the HTML elements on the page.
2. How to formulate an AJAX request using the jQuery library.
3. How to handle the AJAX response by dynamically updating the page with the response data.
4. How to configure the `MappingJacksonJsonView` and the `ContentNegotiatingViewResolver` to re-use existing controller functionality for AJAX requests.
